- **StupidRSS Aesthetic**: Consistent with existing "Stupid Apps" suite

### Key Implementation Details

#### Auto-Title Fetching
- Multi-strategy approach with different browser headers
- Fallback chain: Chrome → Firefox → Bot-friendly headers
- Multiple title sources: `<title>`, `og:title`, `twitter:title`, `<h1>`
- Robust error handling with timeouts
- Handles encoding issues and malformed HTML

#### Authentication
- Single admin user model
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Session-based authentication
- API key system for external access

#### Database
- SQLite for simplicity and portability
- SQLAlchemy ORM with relationships
- Auto-migration on startup
- User-scoped data isolation

## Development Guidelines

### When Working on Issues

**Easiest Starting Point**: Issue #4 (Tag filter visibility)
- Pure CSS/styling fix
- Immediate visual feedback
- No backend changes required
- Good momentum builder

**Code Style**:
- Follow existing FastAPI patterns
- Use type hints consistently
- Service layer for business logic
- Template inheritance for UI consistency

**Testing Approach**:
- Manual testing in browser
- Test both dark/light modes
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Check API endpoints with different clients

### Common Development Tasks

**Adding New Routes**:
```python
@app.get("/new-route")
async def new_route(
    request: Request,
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(auth_service.get_current_user)
):
    return templates.TemplateResponse("template.html", {"request": request})
```

**Database Operations**:
- Always use service layer methods
- Handle database sessions properly
- Use db.commit() for persistence
- Refresh objects after commits

**Frontend Changes**:
- Extend base.html for consistency
- Use Tailwind classes for styling
- Test dark/light mode variants
- Maintain responsive design

## Environment Setup

  pre-commit install
  ```

- **Automated testing**: Implement pytest for API and service testing
  ```bash
  pip install pytest pytest-cov
  # Create tests/ directory with test modules
  pytest
  ```

- **Documentation generation**: Use FastAPI's built-in Swagger/OpenAPI for API docs
  ```python
  # In main.py, enable docs with:
  app = FastAPI(
      title="StupidBookmarks API",
      description="API for bookmark management",
      version="0.1.0",
      docs_url="/api/docs",
      redoc_url="/api/redoc"
  )
  ```

- **CI/CD workflow**: Setup GitHub Actions for testing and deployment
  ```yaml
  # .github/workflows/python-app.yml
  name: Python application
  on: [push, pull_request]

- `models/models.py`: Database schema

**Common Patterns:**
- Service injection via Depends()
- Template response with request context
- User authentication on protected routes
- Database session management

### Branch Management Workflow

The project follows a feature branch workflow:

1. **Create Feature Branch**: For each feature or issue, create a dedicated branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/issue-name
   ```

2. **Implement Changes**: Make commits on the feature branch until the feature is complete
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Descriptive message about changes"
   ```

3. **Push Feature Branch**: Push the feature branch to GitHub for tracking
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/issue-name
   ```

4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all changes work as expected before merging

5. **Merge to Main**: When feature is complete, merge to main branch
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/issue-name
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Close Issues**: Update GitHub issues to mark them as complete
   ```bash
   gh issue close <issue-number> --comment "Implementation details" --reason completed
   ```

7. **Clean Up**: Delete the feature branch after successful merge
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature/issue-name
   git push origin --delete feature/issue-name
   ```
